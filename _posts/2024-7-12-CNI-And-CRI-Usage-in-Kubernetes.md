 title: CNI and CRI usage in Kubernetes
--- 

### CNI (Container Network Interface)
- **What it is**: A standard way to configure networking for containers.
- **Why it's used**: So that the containers can communicate with each other and with external networks.
- **Example**: Calico and Flannel are popular CNI plugins used to set up networks in Kubernetes.

### CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
- **What it is**: A standard interface for Kubernetes to communicate with container runtimes.
- **Why it's used**: To allow Kubernetes to work with different container runtimes without needing to change its core code.
- **Example**: containerd and CRI-O are common container runtimes that use CRI to work with Kubernetes.

In essence, CNI deals with how containers connect to networks, while CRI deals with how Kubernetes manages 
and runs containers.
