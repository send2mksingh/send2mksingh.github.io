 title: Memcached Storage
---
 
Memcached is a type of DB that stores data in key-value pair and it stores data in RAM memory so reading and writing of data is very fast. Memcached stores data in memory (RAM), which allows for quick data retrieval, making it an effective solution for caching and improving the performance of web applications.

### Key Features of Memcached

1. **In-Memory Storage**: 
   - Memcached stores data in RAM, which allows for very fast read and write operations compared to disk-based storage.

2. **Distributed Architecture**:
   - Memcached can be deployed across multiple servers, providing a distributed cache that can scale horizontally.

3. **Simple Key-Value Store**:
   - Data in Memcached is stored as key-value pairs. You can store any arbitrary data (such as strings, objects) and retrieve it using a unique key.

4. **Language Agnostic**:
   - Memcached has client libraries available for many programming languages, including Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C, C#, and others.

5. **Eviction Policy**:
   - Memcached uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy to evict old data when the cache reaches its memory limit.

### Typical Use Cases

1. **Web Application Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed data such as user session information, product catalog data, and other read-heavy data to reduce database load.

2. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Use Memcached to store and check API request counts to implement rate limiting.

3. **Temporary Data Storage**:
   - Store temporary data that doesn't need to be persisted, such as intermediate results of complex calculations or data processing.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using Memcached in Python using the `pymemcache` library:

1. **Install the `pymemcache` library**:
   ```sh
   pip install pymemcache
   ```

2. **Basic Usage**:
   ```python
   from pymemcache.client import base

   # Connect to the Memcached server
   client = base.Client(('localhost', 11211))

   # Set a value
   client.set('my_key', 'my_value')

   # Get a value
   value = client.get('my_key')
   print(value)  # Output: b'my_value'
   ```

### Memcached vs. Redis

Memcached and Redis are both popular in-memory data stores, but they have different features and use cases:

- **Memcached**:
  - Simple key-value store.
  - Designed primarily for caching.
  - Data is stored in RAM and is not persisted.
  - LRU eviction policy.

- **Redis**:
  - Supports more complex data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets).
  - Can be used for caching, but also for message brokering, queues, and more.
  - Data can be persisted to disk.
  - Supports replication and offers more advanced features like transactions and Lua scripting.

### Conclusion

Memcached is a powerful and efficient solution for caching data to improve the performance of web applications. Its simplicity, speed, and scalability make it a popular choice for developers looking to reduce database load and accelerate data retrieval.
