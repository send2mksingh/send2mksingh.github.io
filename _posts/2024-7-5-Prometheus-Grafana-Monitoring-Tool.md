 title: Prometheus & Grafana Intro
---
   
   
**Prometheus:** is an open source monitoring and alerting tool used to collect differect  metrics    like cpu, memory, latency and a lot more from servers, docker containers or even kubernetes cluster.

**Grafana:** on the other hand is an open source data visualization and analysed tool that lets you  create informative graphs and dashboards using data from different data sources. In Grafana we can also add prometheus as a data source to start seeing simple metrics into informative dashboards like this.   

**Monitoring Tool:** Prometheus is designed to gather metrics (data points) from your systems and   applications. These metrics could be anything from CPU usage and memory usage to response times and error rates.


**Time Series Database:** It stores these metrics in a time series database, meaning it keeps track of how metrics change over time. This historical data is essential for understanding trends and diagnosing problems.

**Data Retrieval:** Prometheus periodically scrapes (collects) metrics from configured targets (systems or applications) using HTTP requests. It can also receive metrics pushed to it from special services called Pushgateways.

**Query Language (PromQL):** Prometheus has its own query language called PromQL. This language allows you to write queries to analyze and retrieve specific metrics. For example, you can ask Prometheus to show you the average CPU usage over the last hour.


**Related Terms:**

Exporters: These are small programs or agents that run on your systems and expose metrics in a format that Prometheus can understand. For instance, the Node Exporter collects hardware and OS metrics, while exporters like the MySQL Exporter gather database-specific metrics.

Alerting: Prometheus can be configured to generate alerts based on predefined rules. For example, you can set it to send an alert if CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold for more than 5 minutes.

Alertmanager: This component manages alerts sent by Prometheus. It handles deduplication (preventing duplicate alerts), grouping alerts, and routing them to appropriate receivers (like email, Slack, or PagerDuty).

Service Discovery: Prometheus can automatically discover and monitor new targets using service discovery mechanisms. This is particularly useful in dynamic environments like Kubernetes, where services may appear and disappear frequently.

Grafana: While not part of Prometheus itself, Grafana is often used alongside Prometheus for visualization. Grafana creates dashboards that display Prometheus metrics in graphical form, making it easier to monitor and analyze system performance visually.



**Workflow:**
Setup: Install and configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your systems and applications.
 
Metrics Collection: Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at regular intervals or receives them from Pushgateways.

Storage: Metrics are stored in Prometheus's time series database, allowing you to query historical data.

Querying: Use PromQL to write queries that retrieve and analyze metrics data. For example, you might analyze trends or compare metrics between different systems.

Alerting: Define alerting rules in Prometheus to notify you when metrics meet specific conditions, such as when a server's disk usage is too high.

Visualization: Use Grafana to create dashboards that visualize Prometheus metrics, providing insights into system performance at a glance.


Prometheus is valued for its scalability, flexibility, and robustness in monitoring various types of systems and applications, making it a popular choice among DevOps teams and system administrators. 

**Client Libraries**
    Client libraries in Prometheus are tools that developers use to make it easy for their applications to share data (like how fast they're running or how much memory they're using) with Prometheus, which keeps track of that information over time
   
 - It Supports four languages-
 - GO
 - Python
 - Java
 - Ruby
