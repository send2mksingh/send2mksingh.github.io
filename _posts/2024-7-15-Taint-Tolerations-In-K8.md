 title: Taint and Tolerations in K8

### Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes

**Taints and tolerations** in Kubernetes are mechanisms used to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes. This helps ensure that certain workloads are only placed on specific nodes, or that certain nodes are reserved for special purposes.

#### **Taints**

A **taint** is applied to a node, and it marks the node as having certain special properties or restrictions. When a node has a taint, it repels (prevents) pods from being scheduled on it unless those pods have a matching toleration.

- **Taint Structure**: `key=value:effect`
  - `key`: Identifier for the taint.
  - `value`: Optional value for the taint.
  - `effect`: What happens if a pod doesn't tolerate the taint. Common effects are `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, and `NoExecute`.

**Example**:
```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```
This command prevents any pod that does not have a matching toleration from being scheduled on `node1`.

#### **Tolerations**

A **toleration** is applied to a pod, and it allows the pod to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

- **Toleration Structure**:
  ```yaml
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  ```

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```
This pod can be scheduled on any node with the taint `key=value:NoSchedule`.

### **How They Work Together**

1. **Taint a Node**: You add a taint to a node to mark it with a special condition.
2. **Tolerate the Taint**: You add a toleration to a pod to indicate that it can be scheduled on nodes with that specific taint.

### **Use Cases**

1. **Dedicated Nodes**: You might have nodes dedicated to running certain types of workloads, like GPU-intensive tasks. Taint those nodes and only add tolerations to the GPU pods.
   
2. **Maintenance and Isolation**: Mark nodes that are undergoing maintenance or should be isolated from general workloads with a taint. Only allow certain critical pods to run by adding tolerations.

### **Simple Example**

1. **Taint a node**: Prevent most pods from scheduling on a node called `special-node`.
   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes special-node dedicated=special:NoSchedule
   ```

2. **Tolerate the taint**: Allow a specific pod to run on `special-node`.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: special-pod
   spec:
     tolerations:
     - key: "dedicated"
       operator: "Equal"
       value: "special"
       effect: "NoSchedule"
     containers:
     - name: special-container
       image: my-special-image
   ```

In this way, you can control and manage where your pods are scheduled, ensuring that they run on appropriate nodes based on your cluster's requirements.
