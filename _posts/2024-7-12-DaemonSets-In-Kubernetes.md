 title: DaemonSets in Kubernetes
---


A DaemonSet in OpenStack ensures that a particular pod is running on all or a specific subset of nodes within a cluster. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Purpose**: A DaemonSet makes sure that a copy of a pod is running across all or some nodes. It's used for background tasks like logging, monitoring, or networking services.

2. **Deployment**: When you deploy a DaemonSet, Kubernetes (the orchestration platform often used with OpenStack) schedules a pod on every node that meets the criteria. If new nodes are added, Kubernetes automatically adds the pod to those nodes too.

3. **Use Cases**: Common uses for DaemonSets include running:
   - Log collectors
   - Monitoring agents
   - Network services like DNS or storage daemons

4. **Benefits**: Ensures that necessary services are always available on all nodes without needing to manually manage them.

So, think of a DaemonSet as a way to ensure essential services are running everywhere they’re needed in your OpenStack environment, automatically and consistently.
