### RBAC in Kubernetes

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users or groups within your organization. It allows you to define what actions (verbs) a user or group of users can perform on particular resources (like pods, services, etc.).

### Key Concepts

1. **Role**
2. **ClusterRole**
3. **RoleBinding**
4. **ClusterRoleBinding**

#### **Role**

A **Role** is a set of permissions within a specific namespace. It defines what actions can be performed on which resources.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
This Role allows reading pods (get, watch, list) in the `default` namespace.

#### **ClusterRole**

A **ClusterRole** is similar to a Role, but it is cluster-wide. It can be used to grant permissions across all namespaces or for cluster-scoped resources (like nodes).

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```
This ClusterRole grants all permissions on all resources across the entire cluster.

#### **RoleBinding**

A **RoleBinding** grants the permissions defined in a Role to a user or group within a specific namespace.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "jane"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
This RoleBinding grants user `jane` the permissions defined in the `pod-reader` Role within the `default` namespace.

#### **ClusterRoleBinding**

A **ClusterRoleBinding** grants the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a user or group cluster-wide.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin-binding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "admin"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
This ClusterRoleBinding grants the user `admin` the cluster-wide permissions defined in the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.

### **How RBAC Works**

1. **Define Roles or ClusterRoles**: Specify what permissions are required (which actions on which resources).
2. **Create RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings**: Assign these roles to users or groups, specifying who gets which permissions.

### **Use Cases**

- **Namespace Isolation**: Define roles that only allow users to interact with resources in their own namespace.
- **Granular Access Control**: Assign fine-grained permissions to users, such as read-only access to certain resources.
- **Cluster Administration**: Grant administrative users broad permissions across the cluster.

### **Simple Workflow**

1. **Create a Role** in a specific namespace:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Role
   metadata:
     namespace: default
     name: pod-reader
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["pods"]
     verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
   ```

2. **Bind the Role** to a user with a RoleBinding:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: read-pods
     namespace: default
   subjects:
   - kind: User
     name: "jane"
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: Role
     name: pod-reader
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

With RBAC, you have fine-grained control over who can do what within your Kubernetes cluster, enhancing security and organization.
