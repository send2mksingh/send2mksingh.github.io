 title: Difference between Vlan and Vxlan
---


### VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

**What It Is**:
- Imagine you have a large office with many computers. VLAN is like creating virtual "rooms" or "sections" within that office to keep different groups of computers separate from each other, even if they are physically mixed.

**How It Works**:
- Each "room" or "section" is identified by a unique number (called a VLAN ID), and there can be up to 4096 of these rooms.
- This helps in organizing the network, improving security, and managing traffic by keeping different types of data separate.

**Where It's Used**:
- Used in office networks, schools, and smaller data centers to organize and manage network traffic.

**Limitations**:
- VLANs are limited to the local network and can't easily extend across different physical locations or large distances.

### VXLAN (Virtual Extensible Local Area Network)

**What It Is**:
- VXLAN is like having a superpower to connect multiple offices (or large data centers) together into one giant virtual office, regardless of their physical location.

**How It Works**:
- VXLAN creates these connections using a unique number (called a VNI) and can have up to 16 million different connections.
- It uses a technique called tunneling to send data across long distances, essentially packaging the data so it can travel over any network and reach the correct destination.

**Where It's Used**:
- Ideal for big cloud environments, large data centers, and companies with multiple locations that need to connect their networks seamlessly.

**Benefits**:
- It allows for a much larger number of separate networks (up to 16 million), making it highly scalable.
- It can span across multiple physical locations, making it perfect for modern, large-scale network setups.

### Key Differences in Simple Terms

- **VLAN** is like organizing different groups of people in one office building into separate rooms. It's simple and works well for smaller, localized networks.
- **VXLAN** is like connecting multiple office buildings into one big virtual office, allowing for a much larger and more flexible network that can stretch across cities or even countries.

**Why It Matters**:
- VLAN is great for simple, local network segmentation.
- VXLAN is essential for large, scalable networks that need to span across multiple locations or data centers.
