### Basic `if-else` Statement

This example checks if a number is greater than 10:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

number=15

if [ $number -gt 10 ]
then
  echo "The number is greater than 10."
else
  echo "The number is 10 or less."
fi
```

### `if-elif-else` Statement

This example checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

number=-5

if [ $number -gt 0 ]
then
  echo "The number is positive."
elif [ $number -lt 0 ]
then
  echo "The number is negative."
else
  echo "The number is zero."
fi
```

### Check if a File Exists

This example checks if a file exists:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

file="test.txt"

if [ -e "$file" ]
then
  echo "The file $file exists."
else
  echo "The file $file does not exist."
fi
```

### Check if a Directory Exists

This example checks if a directory exists:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

directory="mydir"

if [ -d "$directory" ]
then
  echo "The directory $directory exists."
else
  echo "The directory $directory does not exist."
fi
```

### String Comparison

This example compares two strings:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

str1="hello"
str2="world"

if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]
then
  echo "The strings are equal."
else
  echo "The strings are not equal."
fi
```

### Using Logical Operators

This example uses logical AND and OR operators:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

number=10

if [ $number -gt 5 ] && [ $number -lt 15 ]
then
  echo "The number is between 5 and 15."
else
  echo "The number is not between 5 and 15."
fi

if [ $number -lt 5 ] || [ $number -gt 15 ]
then
  echo "The number is outside the range 5 to 15."
else
  echo "The number is within the range 5 to 15."
fi
```

### Practicing `if-else` Exercises

Here are a few exercises to practice:

1. **Check if a user is root:**
    ```sh
    if [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]
    then
      echo "You are root."
    else
      echo "You are not root."
    fi
    ```

2. **Check if a number is even or odd:**
    ```sh
    number=7

    if [ $((number % 2)) -eq 0 ]
    then
      echo "The number is even."
    else
      echo "The number is odd."
    fi
    ```

3. **Check if a string is empty:**
    ```sh
    str=""

    if [ -z "$str" ]
    then
      echo "The string is empty."
    else
      echo "The string is not empty."
    fi
    ```

4. **Compare two numbers:**
    ```sh
    num1=10
    num2=20

    if [ $num1 -eq $num2 ]
    then
      echo "The numbers are equal."
    elif [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
    then
      echo "The first number is greater."
    else
      echo "The second number is greater."
    fi
    ```

5. **Check if a file is readable, writable, and executable:**
    ```sh
    file="script.sh"

    if [ -r "$file" ] && [ -w "$file" ] && [ -x "$file" ]
    then
      echo "The file $file is readable, writable, and executable."
    else
      echo "The file $file is not fully accessible."
    fi
    ```
