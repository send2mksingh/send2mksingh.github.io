 title: For Loops with Examples
---



### Basic `for` Loop

This example prints numbers 1 to 5:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### Loop Through a List

This example iterates over a list of words:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for word in apple banana cherry
do
  echo "Fruit: $word"
done
```

### Loop Through Files in a Directory

This example processes each file in the current directory:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for file in *
do
  echo "File: $file"
done
```

### Loop Through Command Output

This example lists all the users on the system:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd)
do
  echo "User: $user"
done
```

### Loop with C-Style Syntax

This example uses C-style syntax to print numbers 1 to 5:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for ((i = 1; i <= 5; i++))
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### Nested `for` Loop

This example prints a multiplication table:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for ((i = 1; i <= 5; i++))
do
  for ((j = 1; j <= 5; j++))
  do
    echo -n "$((i * j)) "
  done
  echo
done
```

### Practicing `for` Loop Exercises

Here are a few exercises to practice:

1. **Print even numbers from 1 to 20:**
    ```sh
    for i in {1..20}
    do
      if (( i % 2 == 0 ))
      then
        echo "Even number: $i"
      fi
    done
    ```

2. **Create files named file1.txt, file2.txt, ..., file5.txt:**
    ```sh
    for i in {1..5}
    do
      touch "file$i.txt"
    done
    ```

3. **Move all `.txt` files to a backup directory:**
    ```sh
    mkdir -p backup
    for file in *.txt
    do
      mv "$file" backup/
    done
    ```

4. **Read a list of usernames from a file and greet each user:**
    ```sh
    for user in $(cat usernames.txt)
    do
      echo "Hello, $user!"
    done
    ```

5. **Calculate and print the factorial of a given number:**
    ```sh
    number=5
    factorial=1

    for ((i = 1; i <= number; i++))
    do
      factorial=$((factorial * i))
    done

    echo "Factorial of $number is $factorial"
    ```
